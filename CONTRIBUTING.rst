If you would like to contribute....

It would be great if you could fork the code and then generate a pull request for us to inspect.

If you find any issues in deploying your own version fo the code we'd love to hear about it and try to improve our documentation.

We mark some of issues as 'Bitesize'. Generally these will help ease you into the code and help you find your way around.
